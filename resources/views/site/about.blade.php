        <p>First off, I always want a fast-loading site with as few (or no) external
          dependencies that could potentially bring a site down.
          I also wanted something that
          is simple to deploy, maintain, and manage, but I did not
          want to give up using Laravel. I looked at <a href="https://jigsaw.tighten.co">Jigsaw</a>
          (which is really great by the way), but it was not exactly what I
          was looking for. And this might not be what I am looking for either.
          But I am going to keep working on it until it is.
        </p>
        <p>Stay tuned for updates...</p>
